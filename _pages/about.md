<!-- # About -->

Hello there! Welcome to my blog!

My name is Sharath Ram Kumar, and I am a Doctoral Researcher with the CNRS in Grenoble, France. I work on model-free techniques for co-ordinated energy management (think smart buildings and reinforcement learning). On this page, you will find my CV, as well as few posts about random things I find interesting.
